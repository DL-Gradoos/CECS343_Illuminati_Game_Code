# CECS343 Illuminati Game Code
_Team Members: **Eunice Chinchilla**, **Crystal Chun**, **Daniel Lee**_

### Introduction
Using the basic principles of the Agile methodology, our group spent the semester documenting and designing a virtual version of the classic board game _Illuminati_, by Steve Jackson. 

### Documentation
All documentation for this project is currently posted on a private repository, the info will be added to this repository's wiki at a later date.

### Code
Our game is written in Java and is built on top of the Slick2D framework to help handle drawing and GUI elements.

### Comments
In hindsight, we would have chosen a different framework to implement our game due to the little support that Slick2D had. This would have let us implement many more GUI elements without having to create workarounds, such as a chat system, which took up the majority of our time. This also would have allowed us to finish tweaking the main game loop so that each player would have a chance to actually interact with the game on their turn.
